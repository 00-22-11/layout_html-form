- check your work using basic recommendations [here](https://github.com/mate-academy/layout_colored-blocks/blob/master/checklist.md)
- make sure you have `method` and `action` attributes for form
- if you have 3 or more attributes, move each of the on the new line (including the first one)
- No need to provide empty `value=''` attribute for inputs
- You need to wrap separate inputs in their own label tags. Such way every one of them will be activated by clicking on label. To combine 2 checkboxes/radiobuttons in one group you need to provide same to needed inputs.
